### Welcome to Pootis Network!

<img src="./logo.png" align="right"/>

Pootis Network was a group of friends, developers, and gamers running since 2011. 

We run various servers for games such as:
  - Team Fortress 2
  - Garry's Mod
  - Deus Ex : Game of the Year Edition
  
and more...

Here, you can find most of our open-source code used for our network.

We hope you have fun.
